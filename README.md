# Mini-Project: Custom Q&A Chatbot for Movies

In this mini project, we will use a movies dataset and perform some basic data analysis to extract some useful information from the data.
In another file, using the same dataset, we will fine-tune a LLM to develop a Chatbot that can reply queries related to the available data. 

The dataset used in this project can be accessed through this link: ([IMDB Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows/data))
